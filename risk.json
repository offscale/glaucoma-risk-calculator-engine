          "abstract": "Objectives \nTo study familial aggregation of primary open-angle glaucoma in a general population and to determine the absolute and relative risks for first-degree relatives.Methods\nFirst-degree relatives of patients with glaucoma (n=48) and control subjects (n=155) from the population-based Rotterdam Study underwent a standardized examination, including perimetry.Main Outcome Measures\nIntraocular pressure; vertical cup-disc ratio; and the presence of glaucoma, defined as a visual field defect with a cup-disc ratio of 0.7 or higher or asymmetry of 0.3 or higher between both eyes.Results\nThe prevalence of glaucoma was 10.4% in siblings of patients, 1.1% in offspring of patients, 0.7% in siblings of controls, and 0% in offspring of controls. Lifetime risk of elevated intraocular pressure in relatives of patients vs relatives of controls was 42.5% vs 6.7%, of enlarged cup-disc ratio was 62.2% vs 16.6%, and of glaucoma was 22.0% vs 2.3%, yielding a risk ratio for glaucoma of 9.2 (95% confidence interval=1.2-73.9). The population-attributable risk of glaucoma was 16.4%.Conclusions\nIn a general population, relatives of patients with glaucoma have a strongly increased risk of glaucoma. Enlarged cup-disc ratio, not intraocular pressure, was the earliest and most prominent feature of familial aggregation. Further studies are needed to disentangle the genetic components of the increased familial risk.",

Participants From the medical histories of 60,666 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who had ocular diagnoses during the study period, 114 subjects with newly diagnosed {OAG} were identified. Methods The database of the Rochester Epidemiology Project was used to identify all Olmsted County residents with a coded diagnosis of OAG, glaucoma suspect, or ocular hypertension during the period 1965 to 1980. Subjects newly diagnosed with and treated for {OAG} who also had documented clinical evidence of elevated intraocular pressure, optic nerve damage, and/or visual field loss consistent with glaucoma were included as incident cases. Population data for Olmsted County were drawn from United States Census data. Crude incidence data were adjusted to the age and gender distribution of the 1990 United States white population. Main outcome measures Estimated incidence rates of OAG. Results The overall age- and gender-adjusted annual incidence rate of {OAG} in a predominantly Caucasian population is conservatively estimated to be 14.5 per 100,000 population. The rates increased with age from 1.6 in the fourth decade of life to 94.3 in the eighth decade. There was no significant difference in incidence by gender. The average annual rate of {OAG} in the last 2 years of the study was 27.7 compared with 12.3 before 1979. This difference is suggestive of the effect of the introduction of a new medical therapy (timolol) for {OAG} during the last 2 years. Conclusions The incidence rates of {OAG} increase markedly with advancing age, and screening efforts should be targeted at both men and women in the older age groups. The advent of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities can have an effect on incidence rates.",

This 275-page monograph, authored by H. Liebowitz, D. Krueger, C. Maunder et al, has recently been published by Survey of Ophthalmology (Surv Ophthalmol 24 (suppl): 335?610, 1980). The purpose of the study, undertaken by the National Eye Institute, was to provide a description of the prevalence and severity of four diseases that are believed to be the major causes of severe visual handicap among adults in the United States. The monograph presents the detailed protocols and record forms, definitions of the specific abnormalities and characteristics, criteria for suspicion and diagnosis of disease, detailed tables of the basic data, evaluation of quality of the data, and discussion of selected findings.",

It briefly describes the origins of the study, the risk factors that contribute to heart disease and the approaches taken to discover the genetic basis of some of these risk factors. The genetic architecture of several biological risk factors has been explained using family studies, segregation analysis, heritability, phenotypic and genetic correlations. Many quantitative trait loci underlying cardiovascular diseases have been discovered using different molecular markers. Additionally, results from genome-wide association studies using 100,000 markers, and the prospects of using 550,000 markers for association studies are presented. Finally, the use of this unique sample in genotype and environment interaction is described.",

Incidence rates increased from 1.2% at ages 40 to 49 years to 4.2% at ages of 70 years or more, tending to be higher in men than women (2.7% vs 1.9%). About half of the incident cases were undiagnosed previously, and the rest were receiving OAG treatment. Of the 67 new cases of OAG, 32 had intraocular pressure of 21 mm Hg or less at baseline (1.2% incidence) and 35 had higher pressures(9% incidence). Risk was highest among persons classified as having suspect OAG at baseline (26.1%), followed by those with ocular hypertension (4.9%) and lowest in the remaining population (0.8%).Conclusions\nThis longitudinal study provides new information on OAG risk, as well as the first incidence measurement in a black population. Although intraocular pressure increased risk, about half of the new cases had baseline pressures of 21 mm Hg or less. Results substantiate the high OAG risk in the population of African origin, especially in older adults; the relative role of intraocular pressure; and the considerable underdetection of new disease after 4 years of follow-up.",
